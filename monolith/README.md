# Gym Management System (Modular Monolith + Microservices)

In this project, i have tried to simulate a movement from a modular monolithic to microservices. 

The project is a gym management API that allows users to manage their gym memberships, customers, bills... 
The system is built using GoLang and PostgresDB.

### State

The project is still in progress. The monolithic part is almost done, and the microservices part is still in progress.
