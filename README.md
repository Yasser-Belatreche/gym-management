# Gym Management System (Demo from Modular Monolith to Microservices)

In this project, i have tried to simulate a movement from a modular monolithic to microservices. 

The project is a gym management API that allows users to manage their gym memberships, customers, bills... 
The system is built using `GoLang`, `PostgresDB`, `Redis` and `RabbitMQ`.
